    <!-- create an ordered list with any questions you have on this week's material -->

    <ol>
      <li>In arrays practice- why was this syntax used :console.log(`Added an animal to beginning: ${animalArray}`); vs console.log('Added animal to front of array' , animalArray); ?</li>
      <li>Lots of reference materials use 'var' but our videos don't. Is it not conventional to use var? </li>
      <li>Would it be possible to go through loop stages from the for loop, to for-in and for-of?</li>
    
    </ol>
